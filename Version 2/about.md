Hi everyone.

Looks like you found my website (which is right now a work in progress).

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Joe, I'm a graduating senior at Penn, and I'll be working with Amazon in July.

This current version of my personal site will likely be more of a personal website, but all professional documents (CV, projects, etc.) will also be available.

If you would like to contact me, I am available at pires.joe.a@gmail.com. Can't wait to hear from you.
