THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE ASAP.

Anyway, this will be my professional website, perfect for whoring my miserable, corpulent self to capitalist interests.
Here's what I'll need:

- Home page - Should be rather slick, but nothing too overdone. Doubles as an about page
- Resume - Likes to a PDF of my resume
- Projects - Slickest of the sites, showcases some of my projects, including ones being worked on at the moment
- Links: Just two: one to the github, the other to my email (the Penn email, obviously)

Once a decent and working version is done, put it up through SEAS. Keep updating throughout the years.
